# Fleet Runner
To speed CI/CD pipeline, I decided to create a custom image from rust-alpine image utilising [fleet](https://fleet.rs) speed and simplifying the original [toast](https://github.com/stepchowfun/toast) config file

Image is available here: https://hub.docker.com/r/skymanone/fleet_runner
